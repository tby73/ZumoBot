About the Project: 
This Project aims to develop a fully autonomous, self driving vehicle which is able to knock out an enemy vehice inside a "sumo ring" by pushing the enemy vehicle out
of the marked area. The vehicle features a Intel RealSense Depth Cam, which will detect the enemy in 3D using Deep Learning (3D-CNN) and attack weakpoints of the vehicle in order to push out the enemy (Anomaly detection - Autoencoder).
